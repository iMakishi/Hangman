\033[4mAbout\033[0m

Hangman is a simple word guessing game you can play in your computer instead 
of using your notebooks or the chalkboard.

This game is meant to be played with 2 persons or more.

Made with Python, this game counts with a bunch of different ASCII pictures to 
make it easier and more fun to follow your progression while guessing the word 
one of the players wrote.

Although the basic logic behind the game is complete and doesn't present any 
flaws when running, my intention is to further develop this game either by 
adding new elements, making it more visually appealing, or even by compressing 
the code into a more efficient, advanced and cleaner way.

Thank you for playing and most importantly,
\033[4mEnjoy!\033[0m

Hangman is pretty straightforward game and easy to understand if you've never 
heard about it.

One of the players needs to first write the word to be guessed.

  \033[4mImportant\033[0m

  - BLANK inputs are not allowed.
  - NUMERICAL/DIGIT inputs are not allowed.
  - OFFENSIVE language inputs are not allowed and will not be accepted.

Afterwards, the remaining player/es, will need to guess the word that was 
written.

Note that you won't be able to check what the word is by scrolling back to see 
it, since it's been automatically erased in order to prevent this.

There's only 7 mistakes allowed before it's \033[4mGAME OVER\033[0m.
Be careful and sure about the guesses you type.

Otherwise,

\033[4mGood Luck & Enjoy!\033[0m
