# ðŸŽ® Hangman

### Welcome to Hangman

Forget about the chalkboard, enjoy playing with your friends at the same time this version of Hangman in a PC. 

### About

This simple Hangman game is made with Python and is meant to run as an executable file and be displayed in a terminal environment such as Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell. Although a simple game at it's core, it counts with a bunch of interactive elements that I personally find entertaining and make the game more enjoyable while playing it.

The game itself is stable and can be runned without any inconvenients, but it does have some flaws that need fixing. I also plan on taking this game on a whole other level by giving it a dedicated Graphical User Interface and filling those invisible gaps of flaws that I don't like by writing a code that can be both aesthetically pleasing, easy to read and efficent. Quite a challange but one I'm most excited about to complete.

#### Thank you and I hope you like and enjoy it.
