### Welcome to Hangman

Forget about the chalkboard, enjoy playing this version of Hangman, with your friends at the same time in a PC. 

### About

Hangman is a simple word guessing game you can play in your computer instead of using your notebooks or the chalkboard.
This game is meant to be played with 2 persons or more.
Made with Python, this game counts with a bunch of different ASCII pictures to make it easier and more fun to follow your progression while guessing the word 
one of the players wrote.
Although the basic logic behind the game is complete and doesn't present any flaws when running, my intention is to further develop this game either by adding new elements, making it more visually appealing, or even by compressing the code into a more efficient, advanced and cleaner way.

#### Thank you and I hope you like and enjoy it.
